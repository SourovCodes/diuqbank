# QuestionBank

A public question-paper bank. Anyone can browse and download papers; signed-in contributors will be able to upload PDFs, which are published after review.

## Data model

```
departments (id, name, short_name)      semesters (id, name)      exam_types (id, name)
     │
courses (id, name, department_id)
     │
questions (id, department_id, course_id, semester_id, exam_type_id, view_count)
     │   · unique (course_id, semester_id, exam_type_id)
     │   · FK (course_id, department_id) → courses (id, department_id),
     │     so a question's department always matches its course's department
     │
submissions (id, question_id?, status, file_key, file_size, uploader_id,
             department_id? | custom_department_name (+ custom_department_short_name),
             course_id? | custom_course_name, semester_id? | custom_semester_name, exam_type_id?)
         status: pending_review | published | rejected — only published PDFs are public
         like_count, dislike_count, pending_report_count — maintained by triggers; view_count
     │
submission_analyses (submission_id, run_id, status, AI verdict + extracted values)
submission_votes (submission_id, user_id, value ±1)
submission_reports (id, submission_id, reporter_id, reason, details, status: pending | resolved | dismissed)

user (Better Auth) + role: user | admin
```

PDFs live in R2 under `file_key`. A question is listed once it has at least one submission.

Sign-in is Google-only (`/login`, Better Auth's `sign-in/social`); the account is created on the first sign-in, and Google reports whether the email is verified, and new users are stored that way. `pnpm import-legacy` marks imported users verified, so their first Google sign-in with the same email links to the imported account (Better Auth only links to verified users). Signed-in users manage their account at `/account` (name and photo; the name through Better Auth's `update-user` endpoint) and their uploads at `/account/submissions` (backed by `/api/v1/me/submissions`). Uploaders can preview their own PDFs in any status and withdraw submissions that aren't published yet; published papers stay in the bank. Profile images are cropped to a square in the browser (`AvatarInput`, react-easy-crop) and re-encoded as WebP at up to 512 px before upload, so the file that reaches the API is small; they are stored in R2 (JPEG, PNG or WebP, max 2 MB) and served from `/api/v1/avatars/{id}`. A new user's Google photo is copied the same way when the account is created (full size, which is Google's URL without its `=s96-c` size option, falling back to the size Google sent). If both downloads fail, the user keeps Google's URL.

Engagement on published papers:

- **Views** — question pages and papers count their views separately (`POST …/views`, from the question page only, see below). A browser counts once a day per page or paper: the API remembers what it counted in HttpOnly `qb_views_q` (question pages) and `qb_views_s` (papers) cookies (`lib/view-cookie.ts`), so a reload costs no database write. It's per browser, not per IP address, because most students share a few campus addresses.
- **Votes** — signed-in users like or dislike a paper (not their own). SQLite triggers in `migrations/0001_triggers.sql` keep `like_count` / `dislike_count` in sync. A question's papers are ranked by score (likes − dislikes), then views, then newest; the top paper opens by default.
- **Reports** — signed-in users report a problem (one open report per user per paper) for admin review. A trigger counts open reports and moves a published paper back to `pending_review` (hidden) at 3 (`REPORT_HIDE_THRESHOLD`). Admins resolve or dismiss reports in the admin panel; that doesn't publish a hidden paper again, which is a separate decision.

Semester names have a strict format: a term (Spring, Summer, Fall or Short) and a two-digit year from 15 to 30, e.g. `Fall 25`. `parseSemesterName` (`@qb/shared/constants`) turns other spellings such as "fall 2025" into the standard one; uploads, admin edits, the catalog and the AI analysis all go through it, and anything else is rejected. Semesters sort newest first by year, then Fall, Summer, Spring, Short.

When contributing, department, course and semester can each be an existing value or a new name. If every value exists, the submission is linked to its question (created on demand). A new name that matches an existing value (ignoring case; departments also by short name, courses only within the chosen department) uses the existing value. If any value is still new, `question_id` stays null and the proposed values are stored on the submission until an admin creates them. A CHECK constraint enforces that a submission has exactly one of these shapes.

## Rate limits and view counts

The endpoints that cost money or can be spammed are limited per signed-in user with Cloudflare's rate-limit binding (`ratelimits` in `apps/web/wrangler.jsonc`, the `rateLimit` middleware in `apps/api/src/middleware/rate-limit.ts`). Per minute: 5 uploads (each one runs the AI check), 30 votes and 10 reports. Over the limit the API answers `429` with `RATE_LIMITED`, a message asking to wait a minute, and `Retry-After: 60`. Cloudflare counts per location, so these are caps against abuse rather than exact quotas. Nothing is limited per IP address: most visitors share a few campus addresses.

View counts are public, so instead of a limit they only count views from a question's page (`lib/view-token.ts`). `GET /api/v1/questions/{id}` returns a `viewToken` (an HMAC of the question id and time, valid for an hour), and the page sends it as `X-View-Token` with its view and its papers' views. Requests without a valid token for that question, from crawlers, HTTP libraries or headless browsers (by user agent), or from another site (`Sec-Fetch-Site`) still get `204` but aren't counted. A token counts each page at most once a minute (the `VIEW_LIMITER` binding, keyed by token and page), so a script has to load the question for every view it wants counted, like a visitor does, rather than replay one token for the hour.

## AI analysis of uploads

Every upload is checked in the background. The API enqueues a message on the `qb-submission-analysis` Cloudflare Queue; its queue handler (`services/analysis.ts`) reads the PDF from R2, compresses it with the PDF processor API (only to cut AI cost; the compressed copy isn't stored) and sends it to Gemini in one `generateContent` call, together with the existing departments, courses, semesters and exam types. Gemini answers whether the file is a question paper, how many papers it contains, and the department (full name), course, semester, exam type, section and batch from its header. Names are matched to catalog entries or standardized (`normalizeCatalogName`: "and" instead of "&", single spaces, no trailing punctuation) — the same spelling rule applies to names typed by uploaders and admins. Failed runs retry up to 3 times.

**Auto-publishing.** The check that runs right after upload publishes the paper on its own when the AI finds exactly one question paper and reads the same department, course, semester and exam type (the same existing catalog entries, character for character) that the paper is filed under. Papers with new entries or reports, and re-runs started by an admin, are never auto-published. `submissions.auto_published_at` records it until an admin changes the status.

**Uploaders** follow their papers at `/account/submissions` (cards) and `/account/submissions/{id}`: a timeline (uploaded → AI check → decision), what the AI said and read next to what they chose, and whether it was auto-published or is waiting for an admin (`/api/v1/me/submissions/{id}`). Uploading leads straight to that page, which refreshes while the check runs. While a paper waits for review, its uploader can fix the details ("Use the AI's details" or "Edit my details", `PUT /api/v1/me/submissions/{id}/classification`); the new details are compared with the AI's earlier reading and the paper is published right away if they now match.

The questions list shows the newest papers first by default (`sort=newest`), or the most viewed (`popular`) or A–Z (`az`). Course names get the standard spelling for numbered parts ("Physics I", not "Physics-I"); `pnpm import-legacy` applies the same spelling to imported names, skipping any that would clash with a course already in the department.

`/contact` shows the contact email, with links that start an email per topic (bug, idea, removal, account and data). The legal pages (`/privacy`, `/terms`, `/copyright`, `/cookies`) share `LegalPage` (`components/legal-page.tsx`) and are listed in `app/lib/legal.ts`, which also holds their "last updated" date: change it, and the pages' text, whenever what the site collects, stores or shares changes (e.g. a new cookie or third-party service).

`/sitemap.xml` lists the static pages, every question with a published paper (its newest paper's upload date as `lastmod`) and every contributor, from `/api/v1/sitemap`. The Worker keeps the generated file in Cloudflare's cache for an hour, so crawlers don't query D1 on every fetch. `/robots.txt` keeps crawlers out of `/admin`, `/account` and `/api/` and points them at the sitemap. Both use the request's origin, which is `SITE_URL` in production thanks to the host redirect.

Otherwise results only flag, never reject: the admin list shows an AI badge and can filter by "Flagged by AI" (not a paper, several papers) or "AI disagrees". The review page shows the AI's values next to the submitted ones, **Apply AI values** prefills the classification dialog with them, and **Re-run** starts a new analysis.

Configuration: `GEMINI_MODEL` and `PDF_PROCESSOR_URL` in `apps/web/wrangler.jsonc`, secrets `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `COMPRESSOR_API_KEY` (`.dev.vars` locally; without them runs fail as "not configured"). See [Deploying](#deploying) for the production setup. Tests never call the real services.

## Watermarked public PDFs

Whenever a paper is published (by an admin, by the AI check, or after its uploader fixes the details), the API queues it on `qb-pdf-watermark`. The handler (`services/watermark.ts`) sends the original to the PDF processor's `watermark-compress` endpoint. That endpoint puts a credit line on top of every page ("diuqbank.com | Shared by <contributor>", ASCII only because the processor uses a standard PDF font) and compresses the file. The handler stores the result in R2 as `watermarked/{id}.pdf`. The original under `file_key` is never changed.

- **Public route** `/api/v1/submissions/{id}/file` serves the watermarked copy. Until the copy is ready, or if watermarking failed, it serves the original, cached for 5 minutes instead of a day. Public file sizes are those of the copy.
- **Originals:** the admin and uploader file routes keep serving the original.
- **Admins:** the review page shows the state of the public copy and can **Redo the watermark**, e.g. after a contributor renames themselves. **Watermark missing PDFs** on the submissions list queues every published paper without a copy, which is how existing papers get one.

## Admin panel

Users with the `admin` role get an **Admin panel** entry in the account menu, leading to `/admin`. The panel has its own shell, built from shadcn's `dashboard-01` block: a collapsible sidebar, a top bar with breadcrumbs, cards, tabs, tables with row menus, and toasts for results (everyone else gets a 404 there, and the API answers 403 under `/api/v1/admin/*`):

- **Dashboard** — queue sizes, uploads over the last 30 days, submissions by status, the newest pending papers and open reports.
- **Submissions** — every paper by status. The review page shows the PDF (in any status) next to the decision (publish, reject, back to review, delete), its classification, uploader and reports. A paper that proposes new entries can't be published until an admin approves them: "Review entries" creates the new department, course or semester (or maps them to existing ones) and files the paper under its question. The same dialog corrects a paper filed under the wrong details.
- **Reports** — open, resolved and dismissed reports with the paper they're about.
- **Catalog** — add, rename and delete departments, courses, semesters and exam types. Entries in use can be renamed but not deleted; a course keeps its department because questions depend on it.
- **Users** — search by name or email, and grant or remove admin rights. Admins can't change their own role, so there is always at least one.

`role` is a Better Auth additional field with `input: false`, so sign-up and `update-user` can't set it. To make yourself an admin, log in with Google once, then run `pnpm make-admin you@gmail.com` (add `--remote` for the deployed database). `pnpm db:seed` also adds an admin user without a login, for the e2e tests.

### How requests flow

```
Browser ────┐            ┌─ /api/*  ──► @qb/api (Hono) ──► D1 / R2 / Queues
            ├──► Worker ─┤              ▲
Mobile app ─┘            └─ pages ──► React Router loaders/actions
                                        (call @qb/api in-process, forwarding cookies)
```

Everything is served from one origin, so auth cookies are first-party and no CORS is needed. Loaders call the API in-process (`apiFetch` in `app/lib/api.server.ts`) with the user's cookies, exactly like an HTTP request, so the API stays the only layer that touches D1/R2. The mobile app calls `/api/v1/*` over HTTPS with a Dart client generated from the OpenAPI spec.

## Getting started

Prerequisites: Node.js 22.22+ (see `.nvmrc`) and pnpm 11 (`corepack enable`).

```bash
pnpm install
cp apps/web/.dev.vars.example apps/web/.dev.vars   # then set BETTER_AUTH_SECRET and the Google OAuth client
pnpm db:migrate                                    # create tables in the local D1 database
pnpm db:seed                                       # sample departments, courses, questions + PDFs
pnpm dev                                           # http://localhost:5173
```

Google sign-in needs an OAuth client (Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Credentials → "Web application") with the redirect URI `http://localhost:5173/api/auth/callback/google`; `.dev.vars.example` has the details.

Open http://localhost:5173. API docs are at http://localhost:5173/api/docs.

Everything (D1, R2, secrets) runs locally through Wrangler/Miniflare; local data lives in `apps/web/.wrangler/state`. No Cloudflare account is needed until deployment.

## Mobile app

`apps/mobile` is a Flutter app (Android and iOS; package `com.bongomaker.diuqbank` on Android, bundle ID `com.diuqbank.app` on iOS) using Riverpod and go_router. It isn't part of the pnpm workspace (it has no `package.json`), and Prettier and ESLint skip it; Dart's own tools format and lint it.

- **Flutter version:** pinned in `apps/mobile/.fvmrc` ([FVM](https://fvm.app)); CI reads it from there too.
- **API client:** `lib/api/generated` is generated from `apps/api/openapi.json` by [swagger_parser](https://pub.dev/packages/swagger_parser) (Dio + Retrofit + json_serializable) and committed. Admin and sitemap endpoints are left out (`swagger_parser.yaml`). Class names come from the `.meta({ id })` names on the Zod schemas in `packages/shared`, so give every object schema a public endpoint returns a name there; otherwise the generator invents one, and unnamed objects that share a property name (e.g. `department`) can overwrite each other's class.
- **When the API changes:** run `pnpm openapi`, then `apps/mobile/tool/generate_api.sh`, and commit both. The API tests fail while `openapi.json` is stale, and the Mobile workflow fails while the Dart client is.
- **Compatibility:** installed app versions stay around for months, so `/api/v1` only changes in backward-compatible ways (new fields and endpoints). Anything breaking goes in a new version.
- **Running it:** `flutter run` from `apps/mobile` talks to the production site. For a local dev server, add `--dart-define=API_BASE_URL=http://10.0.2.2:5173` (Android emulator) or `http://localhost:5173` (iOS simulator).

### Releasing the Android app

Pushing a tag `mobile-vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` on a commit that's on `main` runs `.github/workflows/release-android.yml`. It builds an App Bundle signed with the upload key and uploads it to Google Play. The version name comes from the tag, and the version code is `MAJOR*1000000 + MINOR*1000 + PATCH`, so every release needs a higher tag:

```bash
git tag mobile-v1.0.0 origin/main && git push origin mobile-v1.0.0
```

Builds go to the `internal` track as `draft` releases by default. Promote them to closed testing or production in Play Console, or change the defaults with the repository variables `PLAY_TRACK` and `PLAY_RELEASE_STATUS`. Each run also keeps the `.aab` as a workflow artifact for 30 days.

The Play Console account is a personal one, so production needs a closed test first: at least 12 testers opted in for 14 days in a row, who actually use the app, before you can apply for production access. Until then, release to the internal and closed tracks.

Locally, `flutter build appbundle` signs with the upload key if `android/key.properties` exists (git-ignored; same keys as the workflow writes), and with the debug key otherwise. Debug-signed builds can't be uploaded to Play.

One-time setup:

1. **Play Console.** Create the app with package name `com.diuqbank.app`, and turn on Play App Signing (the default): Google keeps the key that signs what users install, and our key is only an _upload_ key, which Google can reset if it's lost.
2. **Upload key.** Create it once and keep the file and password in a password manager (`keytool` comes with Android Studio, in `Contents/jbr/Contents/Home/bin`):
   ```bash
   keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore upload-keystore.jks -storetype PKCS12 -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload
   ```
   Then store it in a GitHub environment named `play` (Settings → Environments → New environment). Under "Deployment branches and tags", allow only tags matching `mobile-v*`:
   ```bash
   base64 -i upload-keystore.jks | gh secret set ANDROID_UPLOAD_KEYSTORE_BASE64 --env play
   gh secret set ANDROID_UPLOAD_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD --env play
   ```
3. **Google Cloud: a service account that GitHub Actions can use without a key file.** In a Google Cloud project (any, e.g. a new `diuqbank`), with `gcloud`:
   ```bash
   PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gcloud projects describe "$PROJECT_ID" --format 'value(projectNumber)')
   gcloud services enable androidpublisher.googleapis.com iamcredentials.googleapis.com sts.googleapis.com --project "$PROJECT_ID"
   gcloud iam service-accounts create play-publisher --project "$PROJECT_ID" --display-name "Google Play publisher (GitHub Actions)"
   gcloud iam workload-identity-pools create github --project "$PROJECT_ID" --location global --display-name "GitHub Actions"
   # Only this repository's release job (the play environment, on a mobile-v* tag) can sign in.
   gcloud iam workload-identity-pools providers create-oidc diuqbank --project "$PROJECT_ID" --location global \
     --workload-identity-pool github --issuer-uri "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
     --attribute-mapping "google.subject=assertion.sub,attribute.repository_id=assertion.repository_id" \
     --attribute-condition "assertion.repository_id == '817495452' && assertion.environment == 'play' && assertion.ref.startsWith('refs/tags/mobile-v')"
   gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding "play-publisher@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" --project "$PROJECT_ID" \
     --role roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser \
     --member "principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/$PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github/attribute.repository_id/817495452"
   ```
   `817495452` is this repository's ID (`gh api repos/SourovCodes/DIUQBank --jq .id`), which stays the same if the repository is renamed or moved.
4. **GitHub variables** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables): `GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER` = `projects/<PROJECT_NUMBER>/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github/providers/diuqbank` and `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` = `play-publisher@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.
5. **Play Console access for the service account.** Users and permissions → Invite new users → the service account's email. Give it access to the app with "Release apps to testing tracks" (add "Release to production…" once the app has production access).
6. **The first build goes up by hand.** Google Play's API can't upload to an app that has never had a build. Push `mobile-v1.0.0`; the upload step fails, but the run keeps the `.aab` as an artifact. Upload that in Play Console (Testing → Internal testing → Create new release). Later tags upload on their own. Once Google has reviewed the app, set `PLAY_RELEASE_STATUS` to `completed` so internal releases go out without a manual rollout.

## Testing strategy

- **`packages/shared`** – unit tests for schemas.
- **`apps/api`** – integration tests call the API inside `workerd` (using `apps/web/wrangler.jsonc`) with isolated per-file D1 and R2 storage (`@cloudflare/vitest-plugin`). Migrations are applied automatically.
- **`apps/web`** – unit/component tests with Vitest + Testing Library; Playwright covers full user journeys against the dev server.
- **`apps/mobile`** – widget tests (`flutter test`) with the API providers overridden.
- **CI** is one workflow, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. A first job looks at what the push or PR changed: site code (anything outside `apps/mobile` that isn't Markdown) runs lint, typecheck, tests, build and e2e; the Flutter app or `apps/api/openapi.json` runs the mobile jobs (stale-client check, `dart format`, `flutter analyze`, `flutter test`, an Android debug build, and an unsigned iOS build on macOS). Pushes to `main` that change site code deploy once its checks pass; mobile-only and docs-only changes don't. The final `CI` job passes when every job that ran passed, so it's the only check to require in branch protection. Running the workflow by hand (Actions → CI → Run workflow) runs everything, and deploys from `main`. Android releases have their own workflow, triggered by tags (see "Releasing the Android app"). Dependabot opens weekly, grouped update PRs for npm, pub (the Flutter app) and GitHub Actions.

## Deploying

CI deploys `main` after lint, tests and e2e pass (the `deploy` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`): it applies the D1 migrations, then builds and deploys the Worker (`questionbank`). Nothing in the repo names the production domain. The site's URL is the Worker's `SITE_URL` var (auth origin, trusted origin, and the domain in PDF watermarks). It defaults to `http://localhost:5173`, and CI replaces it with the `SITE_URL` repository variable at deploy time. Requests that reach the Worker on any other host (`www.`, its workers.dev address) are redirected there (`canonicalHostRedirect` in `app/lib/redirect.ts`, skipped for `http://` so local dev is unaffected). To move the site, change that variable, the custom domain and the Google redirect URI, then run the CI workflow by hand on `main` (Actions → CI → Run workflow).

One-time setup (the deploy job is skipped until `SITE_URL` is set):

1. Create the resources, from `apps/web` (after `pnpm exec wrangler login`). This is already done for the current account; only a new account needs it:
   - `wrangler d1 create questionbank`, and put its id in `apps/web/wrangler.jsonc`
   - `wrangler r2 bucket create questionbank-papers`
   - `wrangler queues create qb-submission-analysis` and `wrangler queues create qb-pdf-watermark`
2. Set the secrets, from `apps/web`, with `wrangler secret put <NAME>`: `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `COMPRESSOR_API_KEY`. They survive deploys, so CI never sees them.
3. Create a Cloudflare API token with Workers Scripts, D1, Workers R2 Storage and Queues edit permissions. In GitHub (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions), add the secrets `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and the variable `SITE_URL` (e.g. `https://example.com`, no trailing path).
4. Push to `main` (or run the CI workflow by hand) to deploy. Then attach the domain in the dashboard: Workers & Pages → `questionbank` → Settings → Domains & Routes → Custom domain. `wrangler.jsonc` has no `routes`, so deploys leave that domain alone.
5. Add `<SITE_URL>/api/auth/callback/google` to the Google OAuth client's redirect URIs, log in, and promote yourself with `pnpm make-admin <email> --remote`.

## Before going to production (later)

- Add rate limiting on the API.
- Add email change (with verification) and account deletion.
- Add caching for public pages and PDFs, and staging/production environments.
