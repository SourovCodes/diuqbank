          QuestionBank (diuqbank.com) is a free question-paper bank run by{" "}
          {AUTHOR.name}, an individual, not a company. It is an independent
          project, not an official service of Daffodil International University.
          In this policy, “I” and “me” mean {AUTHOR.firstName}, and “you” means
          anyone who visits the site.

        <p>The site has no ads and never sells or rents your data to anyone.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>When you browse</strong>, without signing in, nothing is
          linked to you by name. Google Analytics records which pages are
          visited, from what kind of device and roughly where (country or city),
          so I can see what’s useful. Cloudflare, which hosts the site, handles
          your IP address and browser details to deliver pages and block
          attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>When you sign in with Google</strong>, the site receives your
          name, email address, profile photo and Google account ID. New accounts
          need a DIU email address. Your photo is copied to the site’s own
          storage. Each sign-in keeps a session with the IP address and browser
          it came from, and the tokens Google issues for signing in. You also
          get a username, which you can change.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>When you upload a paper</strong>, the site stores the PDF, the
          details you chose (department, course, semester, exam type and the
          optional section or batch) and when you uploaded it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>When you like, dislike or report a paper</strong>, the site
          stores your choice, and for reports the reason and any note you wrote.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>View counts</strong> aren’t tied to you: a cookie in your
          browser only remembers which pages it already counted today (see the{" "}
          <Link to="/cookies">cookie notice</Link>).

          OurDIU, the QuestionBank app for Android, collects the same account,
          upload and like, dislike or report data as the site, when you do the
          same things. Unlike the site, it doesn’t use Google Analytics or
          cookies.

            <strong>Signing in</strong> keeps a session token in your phone’s
            secure storage, so you stay signed in. Signing out removes it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Saved papers, recent courses and your theme</strong> are
            kept on your phone only, and are removed when you uninstall the app.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scanning a paper</strong> uses the camera through Google’s
            document scanner, which runs on your phone. Only the PDF you choose
            to upload leaves it. The same goes for PDFs you pick from your files
            or share to the app from another one.
